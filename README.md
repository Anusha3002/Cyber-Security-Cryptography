# Cyber-Security-Cryptography

A Cyber-Security cryptography project. Our team works on Cybersecurity — We encrypt your data — cipher-cryptography, We've written a method to cipher 
your data and you can even login and save your encrypted data.

So What’s Cryptography? Cryptography is the study of secure communications techniques that allow only the sender and intended recipient of a message to view
its contents.  
The term is derived from the Greek word kryptos, which means hidden. It is closely associated to encryption, which is the act of scrambling 
ordinary text into what's known as ciphertext and then back again upon arrival.

In the world of digital fraud, to prevent our data, many techniques are used to keep our data safe from 
hackers (or any third party), One of them is Cryptography. We use Cryptography to cipher our data (focusing more on passwords) from any unauthorised third party. 
Nowadays as hacking is exceedingly common and remain a very big threat to our data. Encryption ensures information is kept confidential.

How do we work?

Plaintext (which is the input message given by the user), is converted to Ciphertext (which is the encrypted message) and stored in our db.
